[0.9.0.1]
+ Reordered and added new File menu items. 
+ Reassigned and added new shortcut keys, documented at: sketchchair.cc/reference.php
+ Changed ground colour to make figure easier to see.
+ Various other bug fixes. 

[0.9.0.0]
+ Changing SketchChair development status from Alpha to public Beta.

[0.8.4.2]
+ Prevent Graphic context resize on startup. Appears to have fixed crashing problem on startup but needs to be tested by others. 
+ Slight modifications to gui. 
+ Repositions app window to the top of desktop on open.
+ Fixed bug with app starting with a low frame rate. 

[0.8.4.1]
+ Increased initial Java heap size to 200mb and the maximum to 1024mb. This should resolve the issue with SketchChair not starting on some systems and should also fix the issue with labels and images in the GUI appearing as black squares.
+ Removed memory leaks. 
+ Changed default undo levels to 10 instead of 20
+ Changed render setting causes small inconsistencies in gui that will need to be repaired but improves frame rate by approximately 30%.

+ Bug fixes in slices when editing existing slices.
+ Added mouse scroll number increments to number boxes. 
+ Various other small bug fixes.

[0.8.3.5]
+ Added new function to leg slices "extend to top" this forces leg slices start at the top of the leg shape instead of the intersection between the leg shape and existing sketch.(Fixes leg slices in the Antler Chair design)
+ Debugged two features that stopped working in 0.8.3.4 Paths can be closed by right clicking whilst drawing a path using the path tool. Holding control whilst the path tool is selected allows you to add and remove points along a path. 
+ Fixed render bug on chair preview when sharing designs online. 

[0.8.3.4]
+ Upgraded processing libraries to version 2.0b2. This upgrade bring new OpenGL 2.0 render libraries that improve frame-rate and texture clarity on most machines. However this does mean that your machine will have to support OpenGL 2.0 and some older machines and lower spec laptops with internal graphics cards do not. We plan to also release a SketchChair legacy version to support these machines but for the time being user effected can use v0.8.3.3 .
+ Added SVG export to patterns. Moving forward a modified SVG format will probably be the native format for SVG patterns and will be used for uploading and storing and modifying patterns on SketchChair.cc with the option to export in other formats. 
+ Pattern files are now uploaded when you share  design on SketchChair.cc, more options for this coming soon. 
+ Added new cursors to indicate what tool is selected. Their appears to be a problem with the alpha channel of these on some windows machines. This will be fixed in the next version. 
+ Initial re-layout of tools panels to prepare for new guy in next version. 
+ Clicking on a piece in the pattern preview will now select that item in your model. 
+ A multitude of other small bug fixes and changes. 

[0.8.3.3]
+ Fixed SVG import, a SVG shape is not imported to either the currently selected layer or if no layer is selected one is created for the shape. 

[0.8.3.2]
+ Leg can be added to any selected planes not just outer planes. 
+ Changed how legs are generated. the top of a leg is now calculated from where the leg shape intersect the seat shape. 
+ Fixed bugs with adding Slices and slats to layers. 
+ If no layers are selected the "slices" tool can be used to select one. 
+ When drawing with the offset path tool a path can be completed by double clicking. (still a little buggy)
+ Control nodes on a path are now square instead of circular. 
+ Various other GUI updates. 

[0.8.3.1]
+ Revised GUI elements
+ Changed render engine to use GLGraphics (http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net/)

+ Revised render code for figure. Ergonomic figure now looks more diagrammatical. 
+ GUI Performance improvements. GUI only updates when a element is changed instead of continuously redrawing elements. May not work on all video cards, can be disabled in properties file. 
+ Added material properties to pattern view. 
+ Added ability to change material and pattern packing options in pattern view.
+ Removed button to change to advanced mode, this is now only in the file menu at top of application Mode>Advanced. 
+ Offset bezier path performance improvements. 
+ Other bug fixes.

[0.8.3.0]
+ Added 3D picking to model. To select and edit different layers in advanced mode you may now simply click on them. Holding the 'control' key will allow you to select multiple layers.
+ Added 3D editing , control points can now be selected and edited in 3d. ( still some problems with clicking on overlapping 3d points. 
+ Started to implement jump to context edit. clicking on slices on the model now selects that slice group and jumps to it's properties tab allowing you to edit it.
+ Added 3D preview layer picker to top corner of screen, replaces the previous 3d preview option. This control allows you to preview your chair in 3d as you edit it and allows you to select layers by clicking on them in the preview.
+ Introduced new render mode 3D preview, unselecting all layers will allow you to preview your chair in 3d with all editing points turned off. 
+ Changed some render settings on chair making it easier to tell what is selected. this will probably change a little in the next update. 
+ Added focus mode. when selecting layers in 3D other layers are now rendered as wire frames making it easier to see and edit single layers at a time.
+ Double click to select a object. Double clicking on a object will now select it. Selected object can currently be set to be cut shapes or deleted. 
+ Layers in the layers tab are rendered and selectable even if the layer is blank.
+ Added units to layer width and brush size. (needs to be changed to be relative to scale)
+ Minor font rendering improvements. 
+ Show grid shifted to ALT key.
+ Fixed undo shortcut keys CtrlZ and CommandZ.
+ Pressing spacebar now toggles between 2D view and previous 3D view.
+ Other bug fixes.

+ Selected points can now be deleted by dressing 'delete' when a point is selected.
+ Fixed problem with saved chair preview images. 
+ Added cut shapes. Drawn shapes can be set to cut from the outline instead of adding to it. For example cutting eye's fro twiggy and rock steady. 
+ Fixed bug in scale tool.
+ Added file association with .skchr in MacOS, SkechChair needs to be in your application folder for this to work.\
+ Slats can now be either snapped to a SketchSpline or added anywhere on a model.
